## Our Workflow

### Forking
- We prefer contributors forking the project in order to contribute.

### Branching
- The `master` branch will always be deployable to the live site; all other branches will be used to add features, bug fixes, improve something or to represent some type of work.

### Issues
- We'll do our best to create an issue for everything.
- Feel free to add an issue, just try to be detailed

### Labels
- Issues will be labelled according.

### Committing
- When making a commit to a branch be sure to use plain, simple language that describes the changes made on the branch.

### Testing
- When fixing a bug, adding/fixing functionality, tests should be added accordingly.
